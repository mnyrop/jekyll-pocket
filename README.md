## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-pocket'
```

Then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

And add it as a jekyll plugin in your `_config.yml` file

```yaml
plugins:
    - jekyll-pocket
```

## Usage

Make sure all of your files are using file extensions by setting `permalink: none` in your `_config.yml` file and looking through any custom page-level permalinks.

Then run jekyll build in pocket mode with:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll build JEKYLL_ENV=pocket
```

When the build is finished, you should be able to double click on your compiled index.html page and open up a fully functioning, serverless site in your browser. The links are all relative so you can move the site onto a thumbdrive and share it offline however you like.
